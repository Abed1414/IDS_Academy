# IDS Academy Website

The website consists of three parts:

1-	Hompage part, visible to everyone, people can view official information about the company and interns can apply for currently opened IDS programs.

2-	Applicants part where interns can view their old certificates and exam links and edit their profile.

3-	Administration part where administrators who already exist in the database can manage everything about the programs, employees, pages, and interns.

Mainly what was used was the following:
- For the Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including JQuery, Bootstrap,
  and ajax)
- For the Backend: PHP, MySQL database, and phpMyAdmin using XAMPP server for
  table management
